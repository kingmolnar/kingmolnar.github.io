While there is an abundance of data visualization packages available for various programming environments, if you find yourself in need of a distinctive visualization while keeping your code stack minimal, PostScript provides an elegant answer.

During the time of conducting this research, I opted for Java as the implementation language for my simulation program, which included real-time animation. However, the pixelated output produced by Java graphics proved to be unsuitable for print publications.

What makes this approach of using PostScript appealing is its seamless integration into simulation programs, as it does not require the use of additional libraries. The resulting PostScript files serve as self-contained artifacts that can not only preserve metadata but also retain raw data.

One of the remarkable advantages I discovered while working with PostScript is its long-term utility. The visuals created for my simulation projects using PostScript have been easily repurposed in various other media formats even after several years have passed. This ability to reuse and adapt visuals from past simulation endeavors showcases the lasting value and versatility of PostScript.
