Machine Learning Operations (ML-OPS) is the practice of applying DevOps principles and practices to the field of machine learning. It focuses on the effective management and deployment of machine learning models at scale, ensuring their reliability, reproducibility, and scalability throughout the entire lifecycle. 

ML-OPS involves automating the processes of data preparation, model training, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance, aiming to streamline and optimize the development and operation of machine learning systems.

By implementing ML-OPS, organizations can accelerate the time-to-market for their machine learning applications while ensuring robustness, performance, and continuous improvement.
