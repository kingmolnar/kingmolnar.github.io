<!--mode-->
- #### Cross-organizational data index
  Build comprehensive data index across functional domains: research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing etc. Implement index as labeled property graph on graph database. Design collaborative tool for subject matter experts to define ontology and mapping of data sources to graph entities. Implement ETL workflow to update data index.

- #### Improved document search
  Use entity recognition on text documents to build knowledge graph. Combine semantic queries with graph search.

- #### Rule-based learning and reasoning
  Map knowledge graph to predictate logic. Use inductive logic programming to learn rules from examples.
