- #### Demand forecasting for launch of new consumer product
  Forecast demand of new product prior to launch. Custom DNN time-series model trained on similar products.

- #### Weekly demand forecasting for retail merchandise with wide ranging velocities
  Demand forecasting for weekly re-ordering of about 60,000 products. Use ensemble of multiple models with product level selection on previous weeks.

- #### Cost optimization of shipping materials leveraging time-series forecasting
  Use probabilistic demand forecasting. Model cost of inventory and increased spending when using larger packaging.  

- #### Understand temporal patterns on e-commerce sites
  Time series modeling for seasonal patterns: daily and weekly patterns of site visits, seasonal trends and impact of holidays. Seasonal demand of products.

- #### Clinical Trials 
  Ensure meeting timelines for licensing and distribution in clinical trials leveraging time-series modeling and supply-chain simulation.
