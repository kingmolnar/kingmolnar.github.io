Unattended sensor networks may comprise devices of various modalities, such as magnetic, electrostatic, acoustic, seismic and infrared. Sensor nodes may function as a trip-wire, pointer, identifier or tracker. All these nodes contribute to greater situational awareness by fusing the various data sources. At any given time, however, not all nodes are need in the sensor fusion process.

The objective of this project is to develop a self-organized resource management system that allows to nodes to manage their level of activity with respect to data collection, processing and communication in order to reduce power consumption and to extend the lifetime of the network.
